	bool "Mailbox Hardware Support"
	help
	  Mailbox is a framework to control hardware communication between
	  on-chip processors through queued messages and interrupt driven
	  signals. Say Y if your platform supports hardware mailboxes.

	help
	  This driver provides support for inter-processor communication
	  (IPC) between two processors in a SoC.
	  For example, System Control Processor(SCP) with Cortex-M3
	  processor and Application Processors(AP) on few ARM platforms.
	  SCP controls most of the power management on the AP.

	help
	  An implementation of the ARM PL320 Interprocessor Communication
	  Mailbox (IPCM), tailored for the Calxeda Highbank. It is used to
	  send short messages between Highbank's A9 cores and the EnergyCore
	  Management Engine, primarily for cpufreq. Say Y here if you want
	  to use the PL320 IPCM support.
