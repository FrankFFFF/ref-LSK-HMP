Cooling device power API
========================

Cooling devices controlled by this governor must supply the additional
"power" API in their `cooling_device_ops`.  It consists on three ops:

1. u32 get_actual_power(struct thermal_cooling_device *cdev);
@cdev: The `struct thermal_cooling_device` pointer

`get_actual_power()` returns the power currently consumed by the
device in milliwatts.

2. u32 state2power(struct thermal_cooling_device *cdev, unsigned long
        state);
@cdev: The `struct thermal_cooling_device` pointer
@state: A cooling device state

Convert cooling device state @state into power consumption in
milliwatts.

3. unsigned long power2state(struct thermal_cooling_device *cdev,
        u32 power);
@cdev: The `struct thermal_cooling_device` pointer
@power: power in milliwatts

Calculate a cooling device state that would make the device consume at
most @power mW.
